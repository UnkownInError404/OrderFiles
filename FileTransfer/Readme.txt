                        Hello and welcome to FileTransfer, its my frist script so i hope you like it, and here is some simple rules to run the script.

                                            [1] - Do not Extract the file out off the main folder.
                                            [2] - Situate the script`s folder where you want the files
                                            [3] - The folders name need to be on English, the cmd works in that Lenguage
                                            [4] - Do not touch any folder or file while it is working
                                            [5] - Enjoy the script, i dont known what put here :)
                                            [6] - Yeah it is only fofr windows, but maybe works on linux
